# LB-TriangulationAlgorithm
Implementation of LB-Triangulation Algorithm.
LB-Triangulation is minimal triangulation algorithm proposed by Anne Berry.
Complexity is O(nm) where n is number of nodes and m is number of edges.
Run cGMain.py file.
Input is number of nodes and edges in an arbitrary graph.
Output is a Chordal Graph.
